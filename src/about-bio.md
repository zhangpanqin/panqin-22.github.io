I am an incoming CS PhD student at UIUC ðŸ‘‰ PL/FM/SE, advised by [Professor Lingming Zhang](http://lingming.cs.illinois.edu). I felt very lucky to work with him previously on fuzz testing deep learning compilers. Our paper was accepted by OOPSLA'22; feel free to check out our [artifact](https://tzer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/markdown/artifact.html)!

I am interested in various topics on programming language and software engineering, including software testing and verification. Particularly, I feel excited about **program synthesis**, and am willing to explore its application to various domains.
